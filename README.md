# CapCha

**CapCha** is an Electron-based screen recorder built on OBS Studio and WebSocket.

## Premise

There are a lot of great screen recording programs out there, many of which I have used in the past. However, I was unable to achieve the desired recording fidelity and feature set with these programs. This is my personal project designed to tackle these issues and get me experience with new web technologies.

In particular, I needed a program that could:

1. [Record screens](#record-screens) with customizable video parameters (FPS, bitrate, resolution, etc.).
2. [Playback videos](#playback-videos) intuitively and precisely.
3. [Create clips](#create-clips) with downscaled video parameters and other size-saving measures.
4. [Update](#update) in the future for bug fixes and new features.

## Features

### Record Screens

- Can select which display to record.
- Can change the recording format, encoder, resolution, framerate, and bitrate.
- Can automatically begin recording when certain programs are running.

### Playback Videos

- Has a familiar and intuitive UI for video media controls.
- Has a video timeline for precise seeking.
- Can adjust the video playback rate for slower / faster playback.

### Create Clips

- Can change the clip format and resolution.
- Can create video clips with reduced bitrate, framerate, and audio channels for smaller video files for sharing.

### Update

- Can be updated in the future for bug fixes and new features as a public project.
